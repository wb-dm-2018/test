Primary claim of the analysis of World Bank retirees logevity is that it is less than expected comparing to Life expectancy at 65 years numbers provided by US government's Social Security Administration.

There are number of factors contributing to that based on structure of World Bank retirees data.

To list them:

1. World Bank employees live/work around the world
2. Even US based WB employees may have lived/were born outside US
3. Proportion of males/females retirees is unknown
4. Some of retirees died before reaching age of 65 years
5. Significant part of WB employees have sedentary work
6. Data was collected over period of 6 years

Life expectancy is influenced by socioeconomic factors of contry where person resides. Because of it factors 1. and 2. may decrease life expectancy comparing to US population.

We don't know proportion of male/female retirees in the data. Even if current WB workforce is fairly gender balanced, it may be not so for retirees.  So factor 3. may decrease life expectancy number for retirees.

We shouldn't use data for retirees who died before reaching age 65 in calculation since we comparing it with life expectancy of people reached age 65. If we remove those datapoint, calculated number will increase and be more comparabel to US number.

Significant number of WB employees have sedentary work, which reduces their life expectancy. One of the major lifestyle factor that affects mortality is obesity. That may contribute why WB retirees have lower life expectancy comparing to general population.

And finally numbers were collected over period of 6 years. As we see in part 1 there is overall trend that life expectancy increses year over year. So we will need to adjust retirees numbers based on the year data was collected since SSA propvided numbers are for current year.
